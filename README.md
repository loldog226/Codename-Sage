Sage is a controlled environment in which your C++ code can be safely run and managed without the possibility of a ram leak or data spill onto your host filesystem. With the correct precausions, it is possible to use Sage as an OS since all that is needed is found in any version of a Base Linux Installation. In fact, sage only needs an 8-Bit computer with at least 64kb of ram and about 20mb of storage.
